## Chapture 7 Challenges

### Challenge 1: timing out

Add timeout to withLock

### Challenge 2: ToTheRaces.playground

I can't find the playground so skipping this challenge

### Challenge 3: Individual word counts

show a list of words in each book that update reguaraly

**Bonus: Book** re-sort table to reflect changes in word count (not I did this on the 16ms timer, this isn't a good idea due to the overhead it would cause some refershes to time out really you would want to create a second timer that has more of a slower refersh and lower on the qos chain)
